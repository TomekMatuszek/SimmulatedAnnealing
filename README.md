# SimmulatedAnnealing

Shiny app giving opportunity to experiment with different parameters of simmulated annealing (SA) algorithm.
You can upload population grid data, choose parameters and let algorithm find best locations covering as big amount of people as possible within specified radius.
Input grid layer should have its resolution (in meters) specified in file name - no other number should be in this name.
To work properly, column containing population data should be named **'ludnosc'**.
